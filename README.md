MCMC spectral energy distribution code

Code to used MCMC the mass, age, metallicity and extinction postieror distributions of a stellar population subject to the constraints provided by photometry and optionally metallicity.

This code was first presented in [Usher et al. (2019).](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.490..491U/abstract)
